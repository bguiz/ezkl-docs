# ezkl-docs

Documentation site for [ezkl](https://github.com/zkonduit/ezkl)

Link to live documentation [here](https://docs.ezkl.xyz/)

## Running a local version

You can run the retype site locally when reviewing and editing. Each page gets an edit button and you can edit and save right there, or use your favorite editor and it will be auto-reloaded.

This will create a copy of the site at localhost:5000

```
cd ezkl-docs
npm install retypeapp --global
retype start
```
