The `ezkl` cli provides a simple interface to load `.onnx` files, which represent graphs of operations (such as neural networks), convert them into a Halo2 circuit, then run a proof.

## CLI tutorial ðŸ‘¾

You can easily create an `.onnx` file using `pytorch`. For samples of Onnx files see [here](https://github.com/onnx/models). For a tutorial on how to quickly generate Onnx files using python, check out [pyezkl](https://github.com/zkonduit/pyezkl). You'll also need an `input.json` file with sample inputs and outputs of your model (Note: input shape is no longer needed since this is now inferred by the library).

Sample onnx files are also available in `./examples/onnx`.
#### Initializing the project
To generate a proof on one of the examples, first install `ezkl` 
[!ref](/getting_started)
then generate a structured reference string (SRS):
```bash
ezkl gen-srs --logrows 17 --params-path=kzg.params
```
Note that this SRS is for testing purposes only. 

#### Setting circuit parameters
We then set up the circuit parameters by calibrating our model with `gen-circuit-params`. This command generates a `.json` file of our circuit parameters for future use (replace `network.onnx` with the relative path of one of the example's `.onnx` files):
```bash
ezkl gen-circuit-params --calibration-target resources --model network.onnx --circuit-params-path circuit.json
```
In this example, we will set the `calibration-target` to **"resources"** so that we can optimize for CPU and memory usage. The other option is **"accuracy"**, which optimizes for accuracy given the fixed point representation of the input model. Our circuit parameters are generated, then saved to `circuit.json`. You can customize this file and even change the way it's generated. Learn more about `gen-circuit-params` in the [Commands](https://docs.ezkl.xyz/about_ezkl/commands/) section. 

#### Creating the circuit
Now, we use `setup` to create a proving and verifying key for our circuit, using the SRS, our circuit params, and the .onnx file. 

```bash
ezkl setup -M network.onnx --params-path=kzg.params --vk-path=vk.key --pk-path=pk.key --circuit-params-path=circuit.json
```
This creates the verification key, proving key, and circuit params in the locations you specify. There are a lot of options during setup, which you can view by typing
```bash
ezkl setup 
```

#### Making a proof
Next we will generate a proof that the model was correctly run on private inputs (this is the default setting). It then outputs the resulting proof at the path specfifed by `--proof-path`.

```bash
ezkl prove -M network.onnx -D input.json --pk-path=pk.key --proof-path=model.proof --params-path=kzg.params --circuit-params-path=circuit.json
```

#### Verification
We can then verify our generated proof with the `verify` command:
```bash
ezkl verify --proof-path=model.proof --circuit-params-path=circuit.json --vk-path=vk.key --params-path=kzg.params
```

#### Visualizing our model
To display a table of the loaded onnx nodes, their associated parameters, set `RUST_LOG=DEBUG` or run:

```bash
ezkl table -M ./examples/onnx/1l_relu/network.onnx
```

## Using a pre-generated SRS

Note that you can use pre-generated KZG SRS. These SRS can be converted to a format that is ingestable by the `pse/halo2` prover `ezkl` uses by leveraging [han0110/halo2-kzg-srs](https://github.com/han0110/halo2-kzg-srs). This repo also contains pre-converted SRS from large projects such as Hermez and the [perpetual powers of tau repo](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/perpetualpowersoftau). Simply download the pre-converted file locally and point `--params-path` to the file.

> Note: Ensure you download the files in raw format. As this will be more performant and is the serialization format `ezkl` assumes.

## General usage ðŸ”§
This is a comprehensive list of the commands and flags you can use with `ezkl`. Learn more about the Commands here:
