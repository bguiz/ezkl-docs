The `ezkl` cli provides a simple interface to load `.onnx` files, which represent graphs of operations (such as neural networks), convert them, and run a proof.

## CLI tutorial ðŸ‘¾

You can easily create an `.onnx` file using `pytorch`. For samples of Onnx files see [here](https://github.com/onnx/models). For a tutorial on how to quickly generate Onnx files using python, check out [pyezkl](https://github.com/zkonduit/pyezkl). You'll also need an `input.json` file with sample inputs and outputs of your model (Note: input shape is no longer needed since this is now inferred by the library).

Sample onnx files are also available in `./examples/onnx`.
#### Initializing the project
To generate a proof on one of the examples, first install `ezkl` 
[!ref](/getting_started)
then generate a structured reference string (SRS):
```bash
ezkl gen-srs --logrows 15 --srs-path=15.srs
```
Note that this SRS is for testing purposes only. 

Put a model file (`network.onnx`) and input file (`input.json`) into your working directory, e.g. with something like:
```bash
cp ~/ezkl/examples/onnx/4l_relu_conv_fc/network.onnx ./
cp ~/ezkl/examples/onnx/4l_relu_conv_fc/input.json ./

```


#### Setting circuit parameters
Our circuit is configured with the `settings.json` file. This is created with the `gen-settings` command. 
```bash
ezkl gen-settings -M network.onnx
```
This will produce a `settings.json` file you can use for your circuit. However, you can fine-tune your circuit to optimize for accuracy or CPU/memory usage with the `calibrate-settings` command:
```bash
ezkl calibrate-settings -M network.onnx -D input.json --target resources
```
In this example, we set the `--target` to **"resources"** so that we can optimize for CPU and memory usage. The other option is **"accuracy"**, which optimizes for accuracy given the fixed point representation of the input model. Our circuit parameters are generated, then saved to `settings.json`. You can pass a `--settings-path` to read from an existing settings file, and only modify the parts changed by calibration (e.g. leaving visibility or tolerance unchanged). You can customize this file and even change the way it is generated. Learn more about `gen-settings` and `calibrate-settings` in the [Commands](https://docs.ezkl.xyz/about_ezkl/commands/) section.

#### Creating the circuit
Now, we use `setup` to create a proving and verifying key for our circuit, using the SRS, our circuit settings, and the .onnx file. 

```bash
ezkl setup -M network.onnx --srs-path=15.srs --vk-path=vk.key --pk-path=pk.key --settings-path=settings.json
```
This creates the verification key, proving key, and circuit settings in the locations you specify. 

> Note: You can view the options associated to a subcommand such as `setup` by typing `ezkl setup` with no parameters.

#### Making a proof
Next we will generate a proof that the model was correctly run on private inputs (this is the default setting). It then outputs the resulting proof at the path specfifed by `--proof-path`.

```bash
ezkl prove -M network.onnx --witness input.json --pk-path=pk.key --proof-path=model.proof --srs-path=15.srs --settings-path=settings.json
```

#### Verification
We can then verify our generated proof with the `verify` command:
```bash
ezkl verify --proof-path=model.proof --settings-path=settings.json --vk-path=vk.key --srs-path=15.srs
```

#### Visualizing our model
To display a table of the loaded onnx nodes, their associated parameters, set `RUST_LOG=DEBUG` or run:

```bash
ezkl table -M network.onnx
```

## Using a pre-generated SRS

Note that you can use pre-generated KZG SRS. These SRS can be converted to a format that is ingestable by the `pse/halo2` prover `ezkl` uses by leveraging [han0110/halo2-kzg-srs](https://github.com/han0110/halo2-kzg-srs). This repo also contains pre-converted SRS from large projects such as Hermez and the [perpetual powers of tau repo](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/perpetualpowersoftau). Simply download the pre-converted file locally and point `--srs-path` to the file.

> Note: Ensure you download the files in raw format. As this will be more performant and is the serialization format `ezkl` assumes.
