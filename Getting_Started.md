### building the project ðŸ”¨
Note that the library requires a nightly version of the rust toolchain. You can change the default toolchain by running:
```bash
rustup override set nightly
```

After which you may build and install the library
```bash
cargo install --force --path .
```

If you want to build manually with cargo build, be sure to use the release flag as the debug build will result in slow proofs
```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Rust docs ðŸ“–

Use `cargo doc --open` to compile and open the Rust documentation for `ezkl` in your default browser. We will also have a live link with our Rust documentation available soon.
