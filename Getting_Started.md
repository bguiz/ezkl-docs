### building the project ðŸ”¨
Note that the library requires a nightly version of the rust toolchain. You can change the default toolchain by running:
```bash
rustup override set nightly
```

After which you may build the library
```bash
cargo install --force --path
```

If you're optimizing for speed, run:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Rust docs ðŸ“–
